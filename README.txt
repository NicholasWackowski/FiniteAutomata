Foundations DFA/NFA Project

DEPENDENCIES:
import pandas
import copy

NOTE: if you do not already have pandas installed on your interpreter, you will have to do so as explained here: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html

In order to run the code, navigate to the directory and (using your interpreter) simply run the command:
python FoundationsProject.py

This will run all tests which I have set up, and print their output and relevant information (as explained in TESTS.txt).

Implementation of how I coded the DFA and NFA objects are explained in the TESTS.txt file.
